# Filesystem Simulator (C, Computer Architecture)

A Linux-like filesystem simulator implemented in C for a Computer Architecture course.  
This project models the hierarchical structure of files and directories using dynamically allocated nodes, simulating common shell operations and permission checks.

## 🧠 Features
- Implements core operations: `rm`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and `chmod`
- Uses tree-based node structures for file and directory management
- Includes error handling and permission validation
- Demonstrates pointers, structs, bitwise operations, and dynamic memory management

## ⚙️ Technical Overview
- **Language:** C  
- **Concepts Used:** Pointers, Structs, Bitwise Operations, Dynamic Memory Allocation  
- **Topics:** Filesystem Simulation, Tree Data Structures, Operating System Fundamentals  

## 🔒 Repository Access
This project was originally developed on a private university GitHub account and the source code is not publicly available.  
This repository documents the project structure, features, and technical implementation details for portfolio purposes.
